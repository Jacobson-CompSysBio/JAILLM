Tell me about TAF13.', actual_output='TAF13 is a transcriptional coactivator protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. It is a member of the TFIID complex, which is responsible for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters and the initiation of transcription. TAF13 has been shown to interact with various transcription factors, including p53, NF-κB, and STAT3, and to regulate the expression of a wide range of genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of TAF13 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders. As a transcriptional coactivator, TAF13 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential for normal cellular function. In addition, TAF13 has been shown to have a role in the regulation of epigenetic marks, such as histone modifications, and to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes, suggesting that it may play a role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Overall, TAF13 is an important transcriptional coactivator that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular function. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in normal and disease states.', expected_output=None, context=['TAF13, or TATA-Box Binding Protein Associated Factor 13, is a protein that is encoded by the TAF13 gene in humans.', 'It is a subunit of the transcription initiation factor TFIID', 'TAF13 is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation and promoter clearance: TAF13 is part of the TFIID complex,which plays a major role in the initiation of transcription that is dependent on RNA polymerase II.', 'TAF13 is involved in gene expression.', 'TAF13 is involved in DNA-binding transcription factor activity.'], retrieval_context=['transcription initiation factor'])]"
