# Network Embedding Notes
Below, we cover a handful of methods for embedding networks into vector space. Each section contains an explanation of the method and suggested framework for implementation.

## 1. [Node2Vec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf)

Node2Vec is a framework for continuous, learned, and unsupervised embedding of nodes into some latent space. The method uses an objective function designed to preserve neighborhoods of nodes in a *d*-dimensional feature space.
